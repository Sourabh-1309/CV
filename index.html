        <h2>Hello, there!</h2>
        <p class="para">
          I'm Sourabh from Indore. I am currently a CSE, 5th sem student from
          AITR.This is my first webpage that I've made, I
          hope you like it, and I've used HTML5 for structuring and CSS3 for
          styling.

            class="programming-img"

            alt="programming"

          <h3>I love programming!!</h3>
          <p>
            I grew up watching movies and watching natgeo, disvovery, and other
            channels which provided me information, as I was hungry for
            knowledge. I always wanted to do programming and other geeky things
            because I was interested in that, as I loved doing anything which
            was difficult for others so that I can outshine them, and all
            fortunately I was able to do so by using computers and games this
            would help me in many ways which I'm getting now.

          <h3>I can learn and also teach!!</h3>
          <p>
            I can grasp things easily and I can also teach them in an effective
            manner so that the person would be able to understand and I also
            believe that if you can't teach the thing in an layman's language
            you've not learned it correctly, so that is why I try to explain
            anything which i've learned in an effective manner, which eventually
            helps me in understanding things better and so that I can also excel
            in what I am doing, my main motto is to learn and to have fun, fun
            with the things which i've learned.

      <h3>Social cognition & Persuasion</h3>
          <p>
            Since childhood I used to observe people and their actions and take my decisions accordingly,
            so substantially I developed this as a skill which I can use it in my professional life as well.
            Social cognition is our ability to understand other people, and it enables us to predict their behaviour and share experiences. It's also critical to understanding the many nuances underpinning everyday speech, because people frequently mean something different to what they actually say.
